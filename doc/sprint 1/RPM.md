1. Our product owner was chose to be Alexander Yeara. The product owner first gave ideas for the project and dicussed how the final product would look like and obstacles in design and architecture that might arise.

2. Release Name: Basic Functionality
The purpose of this release is to first determine the software design and implement basic functionalities of the gameplay. Such as the transition from one state to another in the state machine and the implementation of basic physics the Player requires: moving, jumping and colliding within a stage. Also, we also wanted to test newer technologies or at least those we were not familliar with, such as the canvas element and javascript event handlers.

3. We have reviewed the definition of Done.md and have not made any changes. We predict that changes might arise as we dive deeper into our project.

4. However, the user stories of highest priority (those that have to do with basic functionalities) were reconsidered and one was broken down in to parts. For example, the movement, jumping and implementation of crosshair were made into separate parts. We also considered adding user story for creation of distinct elements of the stage.

5. Team communicated well. Some members do not have much experience with the technology used, so there was some delay in work. As time passes, there will be higher productivity.
