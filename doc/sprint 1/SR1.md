# Meeting Overview:

In our first retrospective meeting, we reflected on our sprint 1 as well as our initial strategies we set at the beginning of the course.

We were able to lay out a foundation of our code and complete our initial user stories. Unfortunately, we were not able to do more user stories, but we will definitely be more productive on later sprints. We also discussed about any changes in technologies in frameworks we will use. We concluded that we will try using Go programming language instead of JavaScript (NodeJS), as a member has some experience with it.

The main topics of discussion where the scope of the gameplay and its internal details. We decided that will work on making Monster, Gun and Stage classes. More specifically, we also wanted to add and finish the singleplayer mode by creating health bars for the players, missile/bullet trajectory physics and collision detection of missiles/bullets with Player/Monster objects. After concluding the basic functionalities of the singleplayer mode, we will next work on animations, sound effects and music to make the game more appealling. We will then continue by creating the different states of the game (Menu, Settings, Controls) to state those transitions. There is also a possibility that we would simultaneously work on the server implementation as well.


# Meeting Conclusion:

We all managed to meet to discuss our failures, upcoming work and scope of our game successfully. We concluded that we need to be more productive, work on basic functionalities of the game first and then work on other states of the game as well as server implementation.
