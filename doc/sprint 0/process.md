PROCESS
-------

The team first gathered in person in one of the tutorials to discuss the different candidate ideas for our software project. Most software ideas discussed were already implemented, too vague or too boring to develop. One member, however, proposed the idea to create a video game and also gave some details on the design of the game.

After the initial meeting, we met online using Facebook's chatting system. We dwelled on the uncertainty and inexperience each of us had making games. Therefore, we met 2 times per week to discuss how ambitious our project would be and filtered user stories we believe will be doable by the end of the term.

We defined the user stories by first establishing what core contents and mechanics/functionality a regular user would expect from a 2D platformer shooter game. These include: stage generation, player mechanics, player interaction with "Bots" and overall process of user gameplay. We all agreed that these core functionalities will be layered by additional fucntionalities such as art, music and user interface design. Moreover, the online functionality will be after the core user stories. We did not have to vote to arrive at this conclusion.

We believe we should have spent more time doing research on the overall complexity of game development to have a better estimate of how feasible our idea is to implement in such time constraint. For the next phase, we should have a clearer picture of what is needed for the process in order to go forward with a more specific design.
